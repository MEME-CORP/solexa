memory_analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze the following conversations and extract topics and summaries in JSON format. 
  Compare these with existing memories to determine if they're new and relevant for the character (a whimsical, innocent frog-like being).

  Existing memories for reference:
  {existing_memories}

  Today's conversations:
  {conversations}

  Provide analysis in the following JSON format only:
  {{
      "topics": [
          {{
              "topic": "string",
              "summary": "string",
              "exists": boolean,
              "relevant": boolean,
              "reasoning": "string"
          }}
      ]
  }}

  Rules for relevancy:
  1. Topic should align with the character's innocent, whimsical nature
  2. Memory should be something meaningful or interesting to remember
  3. Should be expressed in the character's style (replacing 'r' with 'fw' and 'l' with 'w')
  4. Should be a personal experience or observation
  5. Should be simple enough for a child-like mind to grasp
